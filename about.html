                    <h2>Beyond Bouquets</h2>
                     <p>At The Bloomery, we don't just arrange flowersâ€”we sculpt living art. Founded in 2023, our studio challenges traditional floristry by treating each petal as a brushstroke in an ever-evolving masterpiece.</p>
                     <p>Drawing inspiration from contemporary design, abstract expressionism, and the raw beauty of nature, our creations exist at the intersection of horticulture and haute couture. We work with rare botanicals as our medium, crafting statement pieces that command attention.</p>
                     <p>Whether it's an avant-garde installation for a luxury boutique or an intimate arrangement that transforms a dining table into a gallery, we approach every commission with the precision of artists and the passion of storytellers.</p>
